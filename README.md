# Guess-the-number
Guess the correct number within the randomly generated numbers in an array

This game randomly generates numbers between (0-99).
You have the option of generating between (10-20) numbers to guess from.
As an added feature, this program sorts through the numbers from smallest to largest using an insertion sort.
Also, when looking for your number, I chose to use a recursive binary search to search through the set of numbers.
